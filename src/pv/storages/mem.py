"""In-memory storage backend with copy-on-write transaction isolation.

Fast, ephemeral key-value storage for testing and prototyping. Uses overlay pattern
for efficient transaction isolation without full state copies.

Features:
- Copy-on-write transaction isolation (overlay pattern)
- Thread-safe with RLock
- Optional observer support for notifications
- No persistence - all data lost on close
- Implements full StorageProtocol

Limitations:
- No durability (in-memory only)
- No conflict detection (last commit wins)
- Memory-bound by dataset size
