- Custom objects for custom Views: hash values, symbolic names, timestamps

type Path = PathToView | PathToValue
"""
A path is a sequence of typed segments leading to a destination.

Views interpret paths, translating domain keys (like -1 for "last item") into storage keys.
Paths understand protocols - DictView paths vs ListView paths behave differently.

Examples:

```python
# Path to users dict
(
    ("users", DictView),
)

# Path to alice's data dict
(
    ("users", DictView),
    ("alice", DictView),
)

# Path to the last item of alice's tags list
(
    ("users", DictView),
    ("alice", DictView),
    ("tags", ListView),
    (-1, str),
)
