"""Subscription system for storage observers.

Provides flexible filtering capabilities for subscriptions:
- Prefix matching: Subscribe to keys starting with a prefix
- Suffix matching: Subscribe to keys ending with a suffix
- Wildcard matching: Subscribe to keys with wildcard patterns (* matches any segment)
- Length filtering: Subscribe to keys of exact length
- Composite filters: Combine multiple filters with AND logic
